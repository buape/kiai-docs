# Logging

Logging settings can be found in `/settings > Logging Channels`. From here you can see a multitude of logging options.

# Message XP

Sends a log everytime a user recieved message xp. The log contains the user and XP gained.

# Voice XP

Sends a log to the selected channels when a user recieves XP from Voice XP. This log contains the user and amount of XP recieved.

# Manual XP Changes

This triggers when XP is set manually using a command such as `/xp set` or any similar command. The log will contain the user who ran the command, the target, and the action that happened.

# XP Decay

The XP Decay log will send when a XP Decay is triggered, and will contain:
 - Amount of users decayed
 - XP Amount decayed
 - A file with a list of userids with their before and after XP. This file gets truncated at 5,000 users.

# XP Streaks

XP Streak logs will provide more insight into what is happening XP-wise. This log will give you the users current streak and the bonus xp that they recieved for their streak.

# Settings

This log will send a message whenever a Kiai setting is changed. This log includes who changed it and the new value.

# Errors

The errors log is used to catch Kiai errors and put them into a specific channel. This log is helpful as it can make resolving the issue faster. Support Staff can use the Error Code to get a better understanding of the situation and what might have happened.
