# What is a Leveling System?

If you’ve never used a Discord leveling bot before, here’s the big idea:  
A leveling system turns participation into visible progress.

## The Flow
1. **Participate:** Send messages, hop into voice, or join events.  
2. **Earn XP:** Every action gives you points.  
3. **Level Up:** With enough XP, your level increases.  
4. **Get Rewards:** Unlock custom perks, roles, or simply bragging rights.  

## Why It Matters
Leveling systems motivate people to stick around.  
Instead of passively chatting, members know their activity helps them progress, which creates a stronger and more active community.
