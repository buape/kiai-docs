# Custom Formula Command

## Syntax

```
/custom-formula
```

## Permissions

This command is available to users with the Manage Server permission.

## Description

This command allows you to set or view your XP formula which is used to calculate the amount of XP needed for a level. The command will bring up an embed showing your formula. To set a new one, you can click the "Set a custom formula" and enter your new formula. It must include `level` and shouldn't take over three seconds to calculate.

Your formula will then be tested with levels 5, 50, and 100 to make sure it works. If it does, it will be saved and Kiai will use it in the future. If it does not, you'll be shown an explanation of why it didn't work and will be able to try again by running the command again.

When using a custom formula for calculation, Kiai will not notify you if a calculation fails or takes too long and will instead use the default formula, `12 * (level * level) + level * 12`.
