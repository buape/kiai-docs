## Getting Started

<Steps> 
### Adding the Bot

Use the following link to add the bot to your server: https://go.buape.com/invite-kiai

### Setting up the Bot

Once the bot is in your server, it will automatically use the default settings to start tracking. You can change the settings by using the [`/settings`](/commands/settings) command.

### Importing Data

If you're migrating from another bot, you can import your data by using the [`/import`](/commands/import) command.

### Basic Multipliers

A lot of servers like to add multipliers to certain channels or roles.
You can do this by using the [`/multiplier set`](/commands/multiplier) command.

### Denylisting channels

We recommend denylisting utility channels like #commands or #bot-spam.
This prevents users from gaining levels by spamming in those channels and encourages real conversation elsewhere.
You can do this by using the [`/denylist add`](/commands/denylist) command.

### Rewards

You can add rewards to certain levels with the [`/reward add`](/commands/reward) command.
Some ideas include: 
- Roles for levels (Level 5, Level 10, Level 20, etc)
- Money in [Unbelievaboat](https://unbelievaboat.com/)
- Custom messages for high levels (such as Level 50)

Check out our full page on [Rewards](/features/rewards) for more information.
