# Voice XP

Kiai allows your server members to gain XP while chatting in voice channels.

By default, Voice XP is enabled and set to a rate of **10 XP per minute**. You can change whether itâ€™s enabled and adjust the rate with the [`/settings`](/commands/settings) command.

Voice XP follows your existing denylist and multiplier rules. There is no limit on how many members Kiai can track in voice channels.

## How it works

When a member joins a voice channel, Kiai waits 10 seconds and then checks if they are still there.  
- If they are, Kiai records their join time (including the 10-second wait) and tracks their session until they leave.  
- If a member is muted or deafened (by themselves or a moderator), that time does not count toward XP.  
- When the member leaves, Kiai waits another 10 seconds before marking the session as complete.  

**XP is only calculated along with any potential level-ups after the member leaves the channel.**
