# Kiai Basics

At its core, Kiai is about **turning participation into progress**.  
The more you contribute to your server, the more XP you earn, and the higher you climb.

## The Building Blocks
- **XP (Experience Points):** Every message, every voice chat, every bit of activity adds up.  
- **Levels:** As XP accumulates, you “level up” — showing your growth to the community.  
- **Rewards:** Server admins can set up role rewards or perks tied to certain levels.  
- **Leaderboards:** Friendly competition — see who’s the most active in your server.  

## Why It Works
Kiai makes everyday activity meaningful. Instead of chatting or hanging out aimlessly, members feel recognized for their contributions.
