Server Rank Card settings can be found in `/settings > Leveling Settings`. In this menu are the options to set the rank card background, primary color, and secondary color.

Everything current (current level, current XP, current rank, current progress bar, and the ring around the avatar) will be the primary color, while the secondary color will show on everything else (XP to next level, Level text, Username text, the # infront of rank, outline of level bar). If a user has premium, and has custom rank card background, primary color, or secondary color set, then that will show instead of the server's rank custom settings.
