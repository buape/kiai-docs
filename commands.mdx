# Basic Commands

Once Kiai is in your server, you can start interacting with it right away.  
Here are the **core commands** every user should know:

- **`/rank`** → See your current level and XP progress (and how much XP until the next level).  
- **`/leaderboard`** → View the top members in your server and how they rank.  
- **`/preferences`** → Open your personal settings for Kiai: adjust notification preferences, and control other personal display or privacy options. This is where users manage how Kiai interacts with them.  

Start with `/rank` to see where you’re at, then use `/preferences` to tailor the experience to your liking.
