# Multipliers

Multipliers are a feature in Kiai that allow you to assign for certain roles and channels. There is also the option "Server" which is a global boost.

Multipliers are good for temporary XP increases a user will receive for having these criteria. 

Good examples include:
    - Giving top leaderboard users extra XP
    - Assigning certain channels extra XP as a way to encourage chatting there

There is also a length setting to set a multiplier to "expire".
