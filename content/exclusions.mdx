# Exclusions

Exclusion settings can be found in `/settings > Denylist`.

Exclusions in Kiai apply to all methods of recieving XP (message, voice, drops, etc). Kiai has 3 exclusion options: Channels, Roles, and Users.

# Channels

Channel exclusions are often set on channels that may be spammed or flooded often or just a channel that is not intended for XP.

# Roles

Roles exclusions can be used to remove the ability for a certain group of users from recieving XP.

# Users

User exclusions are useful on case-by-case basises where someone is abusing the XP system or doing something else that is disruptive.

Exclusions could also be used to prevent top ranking leaderboard users and to encourage a more competitive leaderboard environment.
