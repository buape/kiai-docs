Kiai offers Voice XP, a feature that allows members to get XP by being in a voice channel.

To gain XP, the voice channel must have more than the configured minimum users required to gain XP and will only recieve XP for the time they spent unmuted in the voice channel. XP is awarded when the user leaves the voice channel.
