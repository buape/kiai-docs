# Message XP
Message XP follow a simple set of settings found in `/settings > Message XP`. Message XP is randomly given reguardless of message length.

XP Cooldown specifies how long until another message can count for XP.

Minimum XP per message specifies the minimum amount of xp that can be gained from a message

Maximum XP per message specifies the maximum amount of xp that can be gained from a message

Level Cap specifies the max level that can be achieved. The users will continue to recieve xp, but they will not display as anything above this level.

The Reset Member XP on Leave/Kick option resets a users xp when they leave the guild.

Reset Member XP on Ban resets the xp a user has when they get banned from the server

# XP Formula

The XP Formula specifies how levels will be determined. By default, Kiai uses the formula `12 * ({level} * {level}) + {level} * 12`, which can be visualized here https://www.desmos.com/calculator/jpwyjlqih9.

When making a custom XP Formula, it is important to include {level}, which is replaced with the member's current level and is used to calculate the xp cost to reach the next level.

Kiai does not support restarting XP at 0 each level, but adding `+ {xp}` to your formula will achieve the same result.
